# Predict-Taxi-Fare-with-a-BigQuery-ML-Forecasting-Model


BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage, or needing a database administrator.

BigQuery ML provides data analysts the ability to create, train, evaluate, and predict with machine learning models with minimal coding.

In this lab, you work with millions of New York City yellow taxi cab trips available in a BigQuery Public Dataset. You use this data to create a machine learning model inside of BigQuery to predict the fare of the cab ride given your model inputs and evaluate the performance of your model and make predictions with it.

What you'll learn
In this lab, you learn to perform the following tasks:

Use BigQuery to find public datasets
Query and explore the public taxi cab dataset
Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction
Create a forecasting (linear regression) model in BigQuery ML
Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model
